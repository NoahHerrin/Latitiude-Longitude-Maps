# Latitiude-Longitude-Maps
  Spring 2019, I took a oceanography course where a common task was to determine geographic coordinates and then to use those
  coordinates to find the name of the location. However, when I tried to find a website that would allow me to search by 
  geographic coordinates I wasn't satisfied with the exisiting options. The exisiting options required settings changes in order
  to do the task listed in there url name, which to me seemed like bad design. Therefore I took it as a challenge to make a 
  simple website that let you search for locations using longitude and latitude, no more no less. I used the google Maps api 
  and created a simple form with validation that would then send the search terms to api which would display the location
  in an embeded google maps frame.
  
## Future goals
- Display invalid search parameters to user
- Add support for mobile and other device
- Have search results display in text nearest major location (city or attraction)
